New Zealand's first female FMG Young Farmer of the Year recipient Emma Poole hopes to be an inspiration for other women in the sector.

The 28-year-old Pirongia dairy farmer told Rural News that it's an amazing feeling to have come away with the win after a gruelling three days of finals competition in Timaru earlier this month.

"It was a challenging contest and the other competitors kept me on my toes throughout the whole process, so I am feeling very fortunate to have pulled it off," says Poole.

"As for being the first woman, that is a special feeling; hopefully there will be many more to come and it can inspire more women to enter this great industry.

"We've finally knocked the grass ceiling off the roof. There's a long chain of women that have worked hard to display the important role we play in agriculture.

"All those women have given me the confidence to stand up and give it a go. I'm just a product of what they've all achieved."

Alongside the coveted title, iconic trophy and famous Cloak of Knowledge, Poole received $90,000 in prizes.

The seven regional finalists had their farming skills and general knowledge put to the test with tasks that included repairing farm machinery, creating a hydroponic system and an intense race-style challenge with multiple tasks that saw points awarded for both skill and speed.

Poole believes all the finalists “had an absolute blast”.

“The contest committee went over and above to put on a spectacular show and there was enthusiasm and positivity bubbling out of every corner of the show grounds,” she says.

“It was so energizing and inspiring to be a part of. You also learn a lot about yourself during the competition process – how you cope under pressure, how you can adapt and change to challenges and how you can interact with others.”

Poole isn’t the first winner in the family: her brother and mentor Tim Dangen won the title last year. Poole’s husband Chris won the Waikato/ Bay of Plenty Young Farmer title last year. She was also a finalist in 2019.

Her message to young people eying a career in agriculture is to always consider options.

“There is ample opportunity for any person in this sector to display talent or special skills,” Poole told Rural News.

New Zealand Young Farmers chief executive Lynda Coppersmith says Poole impressed judges with her resilience, broad stroke of skills and knowledge and sheer determination.

“I’m thrilled for her – it’s the most prestigious farming award in the country and it’s incredible to see it go to someone who will be such a strong ambassador for not only the contest but for the entire food and fibre sector as a whole.”

Coppersmith says the talent demonstrated by contestants across the three-day final is proof that the future of the sector is in safe hands.

Peter O’Connor, representing Aorangi, was the runner-up and Otago Southland’s Hugh Jackson finished up in third place.
