Nestled in the scenic Thames Coromandel region of New Zealand, Hahei is a charming rural village that effortlessly marries the tranquillity of the countryside with the captivating allure of its coastal wonders. With its proximity to the renowned Hot Water Beach and the iconic Cathedral Cove, Hahei offers visitors a truly immersive experience amidst breathtaking landscapes and pristine beaches.

The essence of rural life comes alive in Hahei, with its rolling green pastures and picturesque countryside. Surrounded by undulating hills and fertile farmlands, the village captures the heart and soul of rural New Zealand. Here, visitors can witness the serene beauty of farmlands dotted with grazing livestock, a testament to the region's agricultural heritage and a refreshing escape from bustling city life.

In the township itself, there is a general store, 2 cafes, a boutique pub and plenty of places to stay ranging from holiday parks to B&Bs. You will also find tourist activities such as walks, snorkelling and boat trips, whether it be on a kayak or boat. Not forgetting the ice cream and pizza parlour.

Just a stone's throw away lies the world-famous Hot Water Beach, where visitors can dig their own hot mineral water pools in the sand. This unique geothermal phenomenon provides a blissful experience as warm water seeps through the sand, creating a soothing natural spa-like setting.

Another iconic attraction is Cathedral Cove, a breathtaking natural wonder accessible only by foot or boat. A short coastal walk leads visitors to this stunning location, where a magnificent arch-shaped cave frames a pristine sandy beach. The towering cliffs and crystal-clear turquoise waters create a truly awe-inspiring scene, drawing visitors from around the world to bask in its beauty and its fame, having been spotted in the Chronicles of Narnia.
